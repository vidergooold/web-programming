        In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave 
        me some advice that I’ve been turning over in my mind 
        ever since.

        ‘Whenever you feel like criticizing any one,’ he told me, 
        ‘just remember that all the people in this world haven’t had 
        the advantages that you’ve had.’
        </div>

        He didn’t say any more but we’ve always been unusually 
        communicative in a reserved way, and I understood that he 
        meant a great deal more than that. In consequence I’m inclined to reserve all judgments, a habit that has opened up 
        many curious natures to me and also made me the victim 
        of not a few veteran bores. The abnormal mind is quick to 
        detect and attach itself to this quality when it appears in a 
        normal person, and so it came about that in college I was 
        unjustly accused of being a politician, because I was privy 
        to the secret griefs of wild, unknown men. Most of the confidences were unsought—frequently I have feigned sleep, 
        preoccupation, or a hostile levity when I realized by some 
        unmistakable sign that an intimate revelation was quivering on the horizon—for the intimate revelations of young 
        men or at least the terms in which they express them are 
        usually plagiaristic and marred by obvious suppressions. 
        Reserving judgments is a matter of infinite hope. I am still 
        a little afraid of missing something if I forget that, as my fa-
        ther snobbishly suggested, and I snobbishly repeat a sense 
        of the fundamental decencies is parcelled out unequally at 
        birth.
        </div>

        <div style="color: rgb(183, 44, 44); font-size: 0.5cm; text-indent: 1.5cm; text-align: justify; padding: 2%; text-shadow: 4px 3px 3px rgba(255, 0, 170, 0.5);">
        And, after boasting this way of my tolerance, I come to 
        the admission that it has a limit. Conduct may be founded 
        on the hard rock or the wet marshes but after a certain point 
        I don’t care what it’s founded on. When I came back from 
        the East last autumn I felt that I wanted the world to be in 
        uniform and at a sort of moral attention forever; I wanted no more riotous excursions with privileged glimpses 
        into the human heart. Only Gatsby, the man who gives his 
        name to this book, was exempt from my reaction—Gatsby 
        who represented everything for which I have an unaffected scorn. If personality is an unbroken series of successful 
        gestures, then there was something gorgeous about him, 
        some heightened sensitivity to the promises of life, as if he 
        were related to one of those intricate machines that register 
        earthquakes ten thousand miles away. This responsiveness 
        had nothing to do with that flabby impressionability which 
        is dignified under the name of the ‘creative temperament’—
        it was an extraordinary gift for hope, a romantic readiness 
        such as I have never found in any other person and which 
        it is not likely I shall ever find again. No—Gatsby turned 
        out all right at the end; it is what preyed on Gatsby, what 
        foul dust floated in the wake of his dreams that temporarily 
        closed out my interest in the abortive sorrows and shortwinded elations of men.

        My family have been prominent, well-to-do people in 
        this middle-western city for three generations. The Car-raways are something of a clan and we have a tradition that 
        we’re descended from the Dukes of Buccleuch, but the actual founder of my line was my grandfather’s brother who 
        came here in fifty-one, sent a substitute to the Civil War and 
        started the wholesale hardware business that my father carries on today.

        I never saw this great-uncle but I’m supposed to look 
        like him—with special reference to the rather hard-boiled 
        painting that hangs in Father’s office. I graduated from New 
        Haven in 1915, just a quarter of a century after my father, 
        and a little later I participated in that delayed Teutonic migration known as the Great War. I enjoyed the counter-raid 
        so thoroughly that I came back restless. Instead of being the 
        warm center of the world the middle-west now seemed like 
        the ragged edge of the universe—so I decided to go east and 
        learn the bond business. Everybody I knew was in the bond 
        business so I supposed it could support one more single 
        man. All my aunts and uncles talked it over as if they were 
        choosing a prep-school for me and finally said, ‘Why—yees’ with very grave, hesitant faces. Father agreed to finance 
        me for a year and after various delays I came east, permanently, I thought, in the spring of twenty-two.

        The practical thing was to find rooms in the city but it was 
        a warm season and I had just left a country of wide lawns 
        and friendly trees, so when a young man at the office suggested that we take a house together in a commuting town 
        it sounded like a great idea. He found the house, a weather 
        beaten cardboard bungalow at eighty a month, but at the 
        last minute the firm ordered him to Washington and I went out to the country alone. I had a dog, at least I had him for a 
        few days until he ran away, and an old Dodge and a Finnish 
        woman who made my bed and cooked breakfast and muttered Finnish wisdom to herself over the electric stove.

        It was lonely for a day or so until one morning some man, 
        more recently arrived than I, stopped me on the road.

        <div style="color: red; font-size: 0.5cm; text-indent: 0cm; text-align: justify; padding: 1%;">
        ‘How do you get to West Egg village?’ he asked helplessly.

        I told him. And as I walked on I was lonely no longer. I 
        was a guide, a pathfinder, an original settler. He had casually conferred on me the freedom of the neighborhood.

        And so with the sunshine and the great bursts of leaves 
        growing on the trees—just as things grow in fast movies—I 
        had that familiar conviction that life was beginning over 
        again with the summer.

        There was so much to read for one thing and so much 
        fine health to be pulled down out of the young breath-giving air. I bought a dozen volumes on banking and credit and 
        investment securities and they stood on my shelf in red and 
        gold like new money from the mint, promising to unfold 
        the shining secrets that only Midas and Morgan and Maecenas knew. And I had the high intention of reading many 
        other books besides. I was rather literary in college—one 
        year I wrote a series of very solemn and obvious editorials 
        for the ‘Yale News’—and now I was going to bring back all 
        such things into my life and become again that most limited 
        of all specialists, the ‘well-rounded man.’ This isn’t just an 
        epigram—life is much more successfully looked at from a 
        single window, after all.

        It was a matter of chance that I should have rented a 
        house in one of the strangest communities in North America. It was on that slender riotous island which extends itself 
        due east of New York and where there are, among other 
        natural curiosities, two unusual formations of land. Twenty 
        miles from the city a pair of enormous eggs, identical in 
        contour and separated only by a courtesy bay, jut out into 
        the most domesticated body of salt water in the Western 
        Hemisphere, the great wet barnyard of Long Island Sound. 
        They are not perfect ovals—like the egg in the Columbus 
        story they are both crushed flat at the contact end—but 
        their physical resemblance must be a source of perpetual 
        confusion to the gulls that fly overhead. To the wingless a 
        more arresting phenomenon is their dissimilarity in every 
        particular except shape and size.

        I lived at West Egg, the—well, the less fashionable of the 
        two, though this is a most superficial tag to express the bizarre and not a little sinister contrast between them. My 
        house was at the very tip of the egg, only fifty yards from the 
        Sound, and squeezed between two huge places that rented 
        for twelve or fifteen thousand a season. The one on my right 
        was a colossal affair by any standard—it was a factual imitation of some Hôtel de Ville in Normandy, with a tower on 
        one side, spanking new under a thin beard of raw ivy, and a 
        marble swimming pool and more than forty acres of lawn 
        and garden. It was Gatsby’s mansion. Or rather, as I didn’t 
        know Mr. Gatsby it was a mansion inhabited by a gentleman of that name. My own house was an eye-sore, but it 
        was a small eye-sore, and it had been overlooked, so I had a view of the water, a partial view of my neighbor’s lawn, and 
        the consoling proximity of millionaires—all for eighty dollars a month.

        <div style="color: green; font-size: 0.5cm; text-indent: 0cm; text-align: justify; padding: 1%;">
        Across the courtesy bay the white palaces of fashionable 
        East Egg glittered along the water, and the history of the 
        summer really begins on the evening I drove over there to 
        have dinner with the Tom Buchanans. Daisy was my second 
        cousin once removed and I’d known Tom in college. And 
        just after the war I spent two days with them in Chicago.

        Her husband, among various physical accomplishments, 
        had been one of the most powerful ends that ever played 
        football at New Haven—a national figure in a way, one of 
        those men who reach such an acute limited excellence at 
        twenty-one that everything afterward savors of anti-climax. His family were enormously wealthy—even in college 
        his freedom with money was a matter for reproach—but 
        now he’d left Chicago and come east in a fashion that rather 
        took your breath away: for instance he’d brought down a 
        string of polo ponies from Lake Forest. It was hard to realize that a man in my own generation was wealthy enough 
        to do that.

        Why they came east I don’t know. They had spent a year 
        in France, for no particular reason, and then drifted here 
        and there unrestfully wherever people played polo and were 
        rich together. This was a permanent move, said Daisy over 
        the telephone, but I didn’t believe it—I had no sight into 
        Daisy’s heart but I felt that Tom would drift on forever seeking a little wistfully for the dramatic turbulence of some 
        irrecoverable football game.

        And so it happened that on a warm windy evening I 
        drove over to East Egg to see two old friends whom I scarcely knew at all. Their house was even more elaborate than I 
        expected, a cheerful red and white Georgian Colonial mansion overlooking the bay. The lawn started at the beach and 
        ran toward the front door for a quarter of a mile, jumping 
        over sun-dials and brick walks and burning gardens—finally when it reached the house drifting up the side in bright 
        vines as though from the momentum of its run. The front 
        was broken by a line of French windows, glowing now with 
        reflected gold, and wide open to the warm windy afternoon, 
        and Tom Buchanan in riding clothes was standing with his 
        legs apart on the front porch.

        He had changed since his New Haven years. Now he 
        was a sturdy, straw haired man of thirty with a rather hard 
        mouth and a supercilious manner. Two shining, arrogant 
        eyes had established dominance over his face and gave him 
        the appearance of always leaning aggressively forward. Not 
        even the effeminate swank of his riding clothes could hide 
        the enormous power of that body—he seemed to fill those 
        glistening boots until he strained the top lacing and you 
        could see a great pack of muscle shifting when his shoulder 
        moved under his thin coat. It was a body capable of enormous leverage—a cruel body.

        <div style="color: purple; font-size: 0.5cm; text-indent: 0cm; text-align: justify; padding: 1%;">
        His speaking voice, a gruff husky tenor, added to the impression of fractiousness he conveyed. There was a touch of 
        paternal contempt in it, even toward people he liked—and 
        there were men at New Haven who had hated his guts.
        </div>

        <div style="color: purple; font-size: 0.5cm; text-indent: 0cm; text-align: left; padding: 1%;">
        ‘Now, don’t think my opinion on these matters is final,’ he seemed to say, ‘just because I’m stronger and more of a 
        man than you are.’ We were in the same Senior Society, and 
        while we were never intimate I always had the impression 
        that he approved of me and wanted me to like him with 
        some harsh, defiant wistfulness of his own.
